- [ ] for Python and Py-style languages, a named directory mirroring the overall project title
- [ ] For python projects, if it is a package, create `__init__.py`
- [ ] A Unit Testing directory (e.g.,  `test/`)

For hardware projects, the following objects are required in addition to the basic list:
- [ ] A directory for schematics, block diagrams, and design drawings
